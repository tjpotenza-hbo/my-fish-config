# Chris Morrell's Fish Theme

This is a theme I designed for myself but have given to a few friends and decided to publish for others' enjoyment.

## Features

- Minimal base prompt
- Shows compact git status w/ the number of changed files & current branch
- Gives a visual indication when you're logged in via SSH, or logged in as anyone
    but the default user (set the `$default_user` variable to define your default user)
- Shows indicator if previous command failed
- Shows a bright red "!" if you're logged in as root

(Note: _This theme is designed for a light-on-dark theme like [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) but should work in a dark-on-light terminal with a few terminal color tweaks_)
